# ML/dl
This repo contains Machine learning projects that includes data preprocessing , data analysis and evaluation of machine learning models(algorithms).
And also necessary functions of various ml libraries of python.
## car price prediction
This machine learning project is about prediction of car price which is a regression problem.
The dataset contains 12 features including dependent variable.
We do data preprocessing and analysis and develop different ml models and use different metrics to compare the models.
## Diabetes prediction
This is a ml project that classifies whether the person has diabetes or not.
The dataset contains 9 features including dependent feature.
We do data preprocessing and analysis and develop different ml models and use different metrics to compare the models along with model performance analysis.
And also do hyperparameter tuning.
## Python libraries(basics)
This folder contains some of the necessary python libraries for machine learning (data analysis, preprocessing etc).
These have some basic useful functions of the libraries.
